            Context / Content
            <p>The goal for this project is to combine what we’ve learned in unit 2 using command line, git, and github to make our own fun “Choose Your Own Adventure” which stands for CYOA. We had many adventures to choose from and we each listed the ones we like the best from 1-3. In all of these adventures, there are many several choices the player had to choose from to determine whether they would succeed or not. For our group, we’re making a project about the life of becoming an A-list celebrity. All the choices they decided to make would either lead them to be successfully debuted or regrettably eliminated.</p>  
            
            Challenges
            <p>One of the major challenges our group faced while working on this project is planning out and thinking about how the format of our adventure should be like. While planning on our project, we had many different ideas about how it should go and it didn’t really come out that well. Later on, we found a way to combine our ideas into one whole piece. Following up, we were facing another challenge after we had a brief plan for our project. Our whole group had an issue creating all the files we needed. Since our plan was a bit too simple and we were not sure about all the files we needed, we were confusing ourselves about which specific files we should create first. Therefore, we took an extra day finalizing our plan.</p>  
              
            Takeaways
            <p>My biggest takeaway from this project was communication. Since this is a group project, communication played a major role because we had to notify each other when we make changes to prevent conflicts when pushing and pulling. Because of the semester changing, many of our group members were switched to the other classes so we weren’t able to verbally communicate. However, one of my group member is still in the same class as me so it was much easier for us. Our next step is to turn the md files into html files or maybe adding more details to our adventure since I think it’s a bit too simple.</p>
